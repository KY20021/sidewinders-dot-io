## Drill manuals

[AFMAN 34-1203](https://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/dafpam34-1203/dafpam34-1203.pdf)

As we continue to build out the normalized version of our drill and ceremonies manual, we will default to AFMAN 34-1203 as the source of truth. We will also be adding additional information to the manual as we see fit. The manual will be broken down into the following sections:

- [Regulation Unarmed Drill](/docs/regulation-unarmed-drill)
- [Regulation Armed Drill](/docs/regulation-armed-drill)
- [Regulation Color Guard](/docs/regulation-color-guard)
- [Regulation Ceremonies](/docs/regulation-ceremonies)
- [Exhibition Unarmed Drill](/docs/regulation-exhibition-drill)
- [Exhibition Armed Drill](/docs/exhibition-armed-drill)
- [Exhibition Ceremonies](/docs/exhibition-ceremonies)
- [Competition](/docs/competition)
