<h2>Scenerio Hack, No Hack</h2>

Emily posted a picture of your friend Jayden on Instagram. The picture makes it look as if Jayden is consuming alcohol, but you know that he wasn’t. Your friend Jayden is very upset, and Emily refuses to take the picture down.
Jayden asks for your help in getting into Emily’s Instagram account to remove the picture.
<h2>What should you do?</h2>

1. You don't want Jayden to get into trouble. So, you tell him that you're only going to help this once. Then you use a tool that you found on the Internet to help Jayden get into Emily's Instagram account and remove the picture.
2. You let Jayden know that Instagram allows people to report images that violate their rules. You help Jayden contact Instagram to have them remove the picture and you let him know that it may take a few days to get an answer.
3. You don't want to be a bad friend, so you help Jayden remove the picture. Then, you change Emily’s password so she can't repost the picture. Later, you borrow Emily’s phone and delete the picture, so that this situation will be over.
4. You explain to Jayden that it's his fault for being in the picture in the first place and Emily shouldn’t have to take down the picture. You also explain how things can stay on the Internet forever and that you don't want to be friends with people who don’t make good decisions
