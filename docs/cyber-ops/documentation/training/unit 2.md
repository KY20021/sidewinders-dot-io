# Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

- PII is any information specific to an individual

- Examples:

- Date of Birth

- Email Address

- Mailing Address

- Credit Card Information

- Social Security Number

- PII can be used by hackers to steal someones identity, bank funds, etc. 

- Hackers also use PII to impersonate victims in order to gain access to a different person or an organizations network

- This type of information should only be shared with trusted, verified individuals

# Online Safety: The Basics

- Never share your password

- Only share PII when absolutely necessary

- Do not download any suspicious or unknown software

- Always log out when you are done

- Do not click on links from unsafe or unknown sites or emails

- Never post anything you do not want public

- You might think youre being safe and limiting your posts to only friends, but anything you post can be easily copied and pasted and sent to someone else
If youre unsure about anything you do online, ask your parent or guardian if its OK

# Social Media Tips

- Be picky

- Only accept or follow friends you know in real life

- Do not post your location

- Be careful with apps 

- Games and geo-tracking apps may give away your location or other PII

- Assume everything you post online is permanent 

- Colleges and employers check social media accounts

- Dont over-share

- Just because a site asks for information doesnt mean its required to set up an account

- Customize and update your security settings

- Default settings are weak
