# For loops in python

A loop is a programming structure that repeats an instruction for a specified number of times.

In Python, there are two types of loops:

1. For loop
2. While loop

For this project we're only going to use a for loop.

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
For our context, we're going to iterate over a list.

Here is the syntax of a for loop:

```python
for item in sequence:
    print(item)
    # do something
```

The `item` is a variable that takes the value of the item inside the `sequence` on each iteration.
