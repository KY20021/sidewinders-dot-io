# Files And Folders

## File Naming

- filenames never include whitespace IE (my_file.png, not my file.png)
- file names should be descriptive (name_of_thing_in_image.png, not image.png)
- file names should be lowercase
- file names should be in snake_case (my_file.png, not myFile.png, my-file.png)

## Directory/folder Naming

- directory names should be lowercase
- directory names should be kebab-case (my-directory, not myDirectory, my_directory)

## Organization

- For each subdirectory, if a page requires assets, there must be an assets folder, and the assets folder must be in the same directory as the page.

## Page structure

- Each page should include the following:
  - a title
  - a sidebar_position
