Recognizing that I volunteered as a Raider, fully knowing the challenges of my chosen team, I will always uphold the prestige, honor, and high "esprit de corps" of my Raider Team.

Acknowledging the fact that a Raider is a more elite Cadet who arrives at the cutting edge of competition ready to compete, I accept the fact that as a Raider, my JROTC Unit expects me to move farther, faster, and work harder than any other cadet.

I shall never fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong, and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be. One hundred percent and then some.

Diligently will I show the world that I am a specially selected and well-trained Cadet. My courtesy to superior officers, neatness of dress and care of equipment shall set the example for others to follow.

Energetically will I meet the competition. I shall defeat them for I am better trained and will work with all my might. Forfeit is not a Raider word. I will never leave a fellow Raider behind on the field of competition; and under no circumstances will I ever embarrass my unit.

Readily I will display the intestinal fortitude required to drive on to the Raider objective and complete the mission.

**RAIDERS LEAD THE WAY! HOOAH!**
